# Image Generation Using OpenAI

The project uses the OpenAI and DALL-E model to generate the images from the discription provided by the user in the given text field.
User can also choose the size of the image to be displayed.

The project uses OpenAI's DALL-E model to create images from textual prompts by using a generative model. The model is pre-trained on a large dataset of images and captions, and it learns to generate images based on the user's input. The generated images can be used for various purposes such as creating art, creating avatars, or for any other purpose that requires an image to be created from a description.
