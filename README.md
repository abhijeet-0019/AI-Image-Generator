# AI Image Generator 

The AI Image Generator is a project that uses OpenAI's DALL-E model to create images from textual prompts by using a generative model. The model is pre-trained on a large dataset of images and captions, and it learns to generate images based on the user's input. The generated images can be used for various purposes such as creating art, creating avatars, or for any other purpose that requires an image to be created from a description.

## Features
- Users can input a text description and generate an image using the DALL-E model.
- Users can choose the size of the image to be displayed.
- The project showcases the potential of OpenAI's DALL-E model to create realistic and detailed images from textual prompts.
